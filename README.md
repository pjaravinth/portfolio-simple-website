Together, HTML and CSS enable the creation of structured, visually appealing, and responsive web pages. HTML handles what content is displayed, while CSS controls how that content looks and adapts to different devices, forming the foundation of modern web design.
Here’s a **revised and accurate README description** tailored to a portfolio website with **only Home and Contact pages**:

## Portfolio Website

This is a simple **personal portfolio website** built using **HTML** and **basic CSS**, consisting of two pages: **Home** and **Contact**. The Home page provides an overview of my profile, skills, and interests, while the Contact page allows visitors to reach out to me through contact details.

The project focuses on:

* Structuring web pages using semantic HTML
* Styling layouts and content with basic CSS
* Creating a clean and user-friendly static website
* Understanding fundamental concepts of web development

This project serves as a beginner-friendly portfolio and a foundation for future enhancements such as additional pages, improved styling, or JavaScript functionality.
